#

#compute prior probability for each class - spam(1) or not spam(0)
#not spam should = 0.60, spam should = 0.40



#compute the mean and standard deviation in the training set for each of the
#57 features (of the values given each class?)  -- zero standard devasitions
#should be assigned a mimimal stand dev (ex 0.0001) to avoid divye by zero




#3) Use Gaussian Naive Bayes algorith to classify test set
